Predicting the efficiency of the turbo fan of an aircraft engine is an essential part of the aviation industry as a whole. 
It will allow us to know about the functioning of the turbo fan under various circumstances. 
In order to reduce human effort, we can use the approach of machine learning algorithms to calculate the efficiency of the turbo fan of an aircraft engine. 
The primary objective is to find the efficiency of the turbo fan by making use of machine learning algorithms. 
In an industrial scenario, this would ease out the process and would allow people to enhance the performance of the aircraft, improve upon the safety measures and contribute to the economy of the aviation sector.
